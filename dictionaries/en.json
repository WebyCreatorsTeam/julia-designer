As a teenager, I experimented with forum design, creating designs and implementing ideas in Photoshop.</p><p>While studying at college, I was lucky enough to start working as a junior designer in a printing house. From that moment on, I began my professional path.</p><p>Today, I live in Israel and dream of making the world \"tomorrow\" even more beautiful and understandable than \"today\". In addition to my main specialization - print design and prepress, I plunged into the world of UX / UI, which undoubtedly only expands my capabilities in achieving my goals.</p><p>My skills: branding and corporate identity, UX / UI design, print design, prepress.</p>"
